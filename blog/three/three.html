    <h1>diving into GNU/Linux and C language</h1>
    <p>1016/9/9</p>
    <p>I'ts been a while since i wanna start working on myself to be able to write and manipulate code on paper.</p><p>I also wanted to dive into linux things, but there were some reasons that i didn't push myself to it like: <br>1-I don't have another PC or laptop to install linux on it. <br>2-I thaught it's just a waste of time to learn a lot about virtual machines and use my resources when i don't have any idea or project that it couldn't be done on windows. <br>So combining those reasons today i thaught to myself: "hmmm... I'm ust gonna learn GNU/Linux programming on paper no matter what. i think it can help me develop myself to write and manipulate code on paper and have some perspectives on linux</p> <br>
